<img src="images/jan.jpeg" height="250" width="300" align="right"><br><br>
<p>The scheme is expected to benefit about 89 lakh households, which are not covered under PMJAY or the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.

    Similar to PMJAY, the new health insurance scheme will most likely issue a card to all the beneficiaries. The process of making these beneficiary cards will begin in May at the Suvidha Kendra or empanelled hospitals. Also, the secondary and tertiary hospitalisation costs will be sponsored by the state authorities.
    
    At present, there are a total of 904 empanelled hospitals, including 208 personal hospitals, under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana. The same hospitals will provide treatment to the beneficiary families under the Mukhyamantri Jan Arogya Yojana.<a href="https://www.livehindustan.com/bihar/story-bihar-to-start-cm-jan-arogya-yojana-crores-people-deprived-of-ayushman-bharat-scheme-will-get-free-treatment-7126474.html">click here</a> </p>
